# tvshowfinder

need server start out by sending home.html page

	when user clicks start survey
	
		need server to send survey.html page
		
		in apiRoutes, need to take data from survey.html page, parse? and compare against
		data in tvShows.js  and output JSON into modal
		
		

also from the home page, when user clicks see all shows

		need server to send json with all shows from tvShows.js file also in modal?
		
		
		and one more question: i decided to do a tv show finder, to try to be a little different but also have the app do the same stuff the homework requires.  instead of having a person take a survey, and push it to my tvshows array (the equivalent of the friends.js file) would it be ok if i have a second option on the home page besides survey that allows the user to add a tv show based on answering the 10 questions.  so they would take a survey to find which show matched them and have it output a show based on matching them.   but also have an add show option that will 
		
		do i have the right parser?
		
		display all friends in modal or what form?
